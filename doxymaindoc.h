@section introduction Introduction

Profile service is a new subsysten that consists of two parts:
- profiled - daemon process that keeps track of current profile settings
- libprofile - client library for accessing the profile data.

@section architecture Architecture

High level view to system utilizing profile service:
<ol>
<li> Profile daemon supports any number of clients
<li> Application code includes libprofile.h
<li> Application binary is linked against libprofile.so
<li> Libprofile utilizes D-Bus to communicate with the server
<li> Configuration data files define default profile values
<li> Profile daemon accepts request and sends signals on dbus
<li> Changes to profile values are stored to a file
<li> As is the name of currently active profile
</ol>
